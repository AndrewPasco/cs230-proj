**CS230 Final Project - Andrew Pasco and Jorge Garcia**

Machine learning for vision-based tactile sensing.

Current approach: 

Implemented: 
- MiniUNet for segmentation

TODO:
- Detection network
- Object direction prediction
    - PCA/other traditional baseline
    - Learning-based direction prediction

- Alternative approach with 3D reconstruction based on surface normal prediction    
    - Could use similar direction prediction approach given 3D mesh rather than segmented 2D contour
